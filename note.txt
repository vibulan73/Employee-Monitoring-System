# 7. Troubleshooting Email Failure
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Your application logs show a "MailConnectException" (from your earlier logs).
# This usually happens if the environment variables for email are missing or incorrect on Render.

# ACTION: Check Render Environment Variables
# 1. Go to Render Dashboard -> Backend -> Environment Variables.
# 2. Check if the following variables exist and are correct:

# MAIL_USERNAME: vibulan73@gmail.com
# MAIL_PASSWORD: is this set to your App Password (16 characters)? 
# ADMIN_EMAIL: vibulan73@gmail.com

# IF THEY ARE MISSING:
# Add them now! 
# Your local code has defaults, but CLOUD code needs these to be manually set in Render.

# IF THEY EXIST:
# 1. Verify the App Password is correct (try generating a new one in Google Account -> Security -> 2-Step Verification -> App Passwords).
# 2. Update the MAIL_PASSWORD variable in Render.
